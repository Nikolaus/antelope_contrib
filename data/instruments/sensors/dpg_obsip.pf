    Differential Pressure Gauge (DPG) OBSIP-SIO Configuration

    Using measurements from strain gauge full scale outputs,
    the average is about 57 mv/7e3 PA. (FSO is 75e-3V/7e3PA).
    According to Cox et al there is a mechanical attenuation
    factor due to the compressibility of the oil and the
    compliance of the chamber. They estimate this as 0.86.
    Willoughby et al say they measured the response and deduced
    this factor as 0.924. Using a value of 0.9 is suggested until
    a better value can be determined. Thus the STAGE 1 gain should
    be 5.7e-2*0.9/7e3 or:

    S(DPG) = 7.3 Î¼V/Pa -or- (7.3e-6 V/Pa)
