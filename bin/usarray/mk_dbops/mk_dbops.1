.SH DESCRIPTION

.SS Background
The EarthScope USArray Transportable Array (TA) network of 400+ 
currently operational seismic stations and approximately 1800 lifetime  
installations, prompted development of additional relations (tables) 
to keep track of operational information at the Array Network Facility (ANF).
Tables were created to keep track of communication setup, inclusion time
in the virtual network, and adoption status if the station is still 
operational.  Many tools have been developed to make use of this information.
See for instance, \fBwebdlmon(3H)\fP, \fBdeployment2vnd(1)\fP, \fBrt_baler_info(1)\fP,
\fBrt_daily_return(1)\fP, and \fBorbmonrtd_pf_generator(1)\fP.  For the first 700 
or so stations, the deployment and comm tables were edited using \fBdbe(1)\fP:  
a slow, tedious process that was prone to error.  

.SS "Dataflow and Procedures at the ANF"
.LP
At the ANF, newly installed stations are quarantined into a \fIprelim\fP ORB until
metadata is available.  Data is also written out to disk into a \fIprelim\fP DB as 
a precaution against a corruption of the \fIprelim\fP ORB, or the overwrite of the 
first \fIprelim\fP data received.
.LP
Upon receipt of the metadata, \fBdbbuild(1)\fP is used to update the dbmaster 
tables.  A dataless SEED file is generated and passed to downstream users via 
\fBmk_dmc_files(1)\fP (which uses \fBorbxfer2(1)\fP).  The quarantined data is 
now transferred via \fBorb2orb(1)\fP to the \fIcertified\fP ORB where it is written 
out to disk with \fBorb2db(1)\fP.
.LP
At this point, following the old procedures, the \fIdeployment\fP, \fIcomm\fP, 
and \fIdlsite\fP tables would be updated via \fBdbe(1)\fP in a process which 
took significant time and concentration and led to various errors due to typos 
or omission.  As the amount of stations increased, a new method for updates was
called for and the development of \fBmk_dbops\fP began.
.LP
.SS "New approach"
.LP
In order to reduce errors and to make the process easier and less time consuming,
\fBmk_dbops\fP was written to automatically update the adoption, comm, deployment, and
dlsite tables when there is:  a new station installation; a station removal or adoption; 
or a communications update to an existing station.  Instead of having
to fill the fields by hand, the various times are collected from existing databases
or orbs whenever possible.  A parameter file maintains the default locations of 
these orbs and dbs, with command line overrides possible.  Later review of procedures
determined that the dlsite table was more detrimental to operations than helpful, so
its use has been mostly deprecated.  See the \fI-n\fP and \fI-y\fP discussion in the 
OPTIONS section of this man page.
.LP
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
See the EXAMPLE section for how needed command line options differ depending on the type
of update (installation, comms update, removal, or adoption).  One and only one of \fI-I\fP, 
\fI-U\fP, \fI-R\fP, \fI-A\fP, or \fI-D\fP must be used.  

.IP -I
Station installation.  Updates occur in two tables:  comm, deployment with optional
updates in dlsite.  Requires that \fItimestamp\fP be the station certification time.
.IP -U
Communication update for pre-existing station.  Updates occur in 
two tables:  comm and dlsite (optionally).  Requires that \fItimestamp\fP be the time of new 
communications.  End time for previous communication will be 1 second earlier 
than \fItimestamp\fP.
.IP -R
Station removal.  Updates occur in three tables:  comm, deployment, 
and optionally dlsite.  Requires that \fItimestamp\fP be the station decertification time.  
If the station operation is taken over by another group, use the 
\fI-A\fP option instead. 
.IP -D
Drop station.  Updates occur in three tables:  comm, deployment, 
and optionally dlsite.  Requires that \fItimestamp\fP be the station decertification time.  
Used when a station is still in operations, normally by an outside group, (i.e. has
not been removed)  and thus has no endtime in the stage table, but the station is 
to be removed from the "deployment" (i.e. closed in the vnet).
.IP -A
Station adoption.  Updates occur in adoption and deployment tables.  Updates may 
also occur in dlsite (optionally) and comm if the adoption type is not EARN.  This option starts 
an interactive mode where additional information is requested.  When prompted fill 
in:  the adoption type, new vnet code if it is an EARN or TRANSITION adoption type, 
the new station name;  new network code that the station will be 
operating under; responsible data center (15 char max).  

If you do not have information on the new station name, the \fIsta\fP and \fIsnet\fP 
from the command line is used (defaults shown after prompt).  When there is a 
station adoption, the deployment.equip_remove is left null.  

Currently there are only four \fIadoption_types\fP available: E (EARN), T (OPERATOR TRANSITION), 
R (REFNET/BACKBONE), and X (CEUSN/1N4).  See PARAMETER FILE section below for additional description.

.IP -k
Keep created backup files.  Backups of the tables to be modified are always created 
and appear as \fIdbops.table+\fP.  Any backup files already existing 
are overwritten.  This option overrides the default behavior which is to remove 
these backup files upon successful completion of the script.

.IP "-d duty_cycle_status"
Text indicating whether or not the comms are on a duty cycle.  Typical values are
\fIyes\fP or \fIno\fP.  Default is the null value "-".

.IP "-e power_type"
Text indicating the type of power used at the station.  Typical values are
\fIAC\fP, \fIsolar\fP, \fIwind\fP or \fIunknown\fP.  Default is the null value "-".

.IP "-V vnet"
Virtual network code to be used in the deployment table.  Overrides default
found in pf.   Only valid when using \fI-I\fP, an installation or when the deployment
table has multiple records for a single station (i.e. both a _US-TA and _US-EARN record).

.IP "-P prelimORB "
Preliminary ORB used to gather the \fIdeployment.time\fP value during an installation, \fI-I\fP.
Overrides the default found in \fIpf\fP. 

.IP "-w prelimwfDB"
Use the preliminary waveform database during an installation, \fI-I\fP, to 
gather the \fIdeployment.time\fP value rather than the value obtained from
the \fIprelimORB\fP.
Use the waveform database during a removal, \fI-R\fP, to gather the 
\fIdeployment.endtime\fP value.  Overrides the default found in \fIpf\fP. 

.IP "-m source_match"
Packet source match used during installation update, \fI-I\fP, for collecting 
the \fIdeployment.time\fP value.  The default looks for packets which match \fIsnet_sta.*M40\fP.

.IP "-S statusORB "
Status ORB used by the \fBq330_location(1)\fP program during an installation, \fI-I\fP if \fI-n\fP
is not selected.  Overrides the default found in \fIpf\fP. 

.IP -n 
DEPRECATED.  Default is now set to not run the \fBq330_location(1)\fP program or attempt any updates
to the dlsite table.  You can get the \fBq330_location(1)\fP script to run by using the \fI-y\fP option. 

.IP -y 
Default behavior is to not run the \fBq330_location(1)\fP program or attempt any updates
to the dlsite table.  If you do require or have a pre-existing dlsite table, use this option 
to activate update attempts for the dlsite table. The \fBq330_location(1)\fP program has 
verbose output and is limited to the station you are attempting to update.  
See \fBq330_location(1)\fP.

.IP "-W wfDB"
Use this certified waveform database during a removal, \fI-R\fP, to gather the 
\fIdeployment.endtime\fP value.  Overrides the default found in \fIpf\fP. 

.IP "-s siteDB"
Database containing stage table if different from \fIdbops\fP database.  \fIstage.time\fP
is used for \fIcomm.time\fP during an installation, \fI-I\fP and for deployment table
updates for an adoption, \fI-A\fP.  \fIstage.endtime\fP is used
for \fIcomm.endtime\fP and \fIdlsite.endtime\fP during a removal, \fI-R\fP.

.IP "-p pf "
Parameter file to use.  Default \fIpf\fP is \fImk_dbops.pf\fP.

.IP -v 
Verbose log output.

.IP dbopsdb
Database containing adoption, comm, deployment, and dlsite tables that are to be updated.
Be sure to use \fI-s\fP if \fIdbopsdb\fP does not also contain the stage table.

.IP snet
Seed network code for station.  Note this is different from the virtual network code.

.IP sta
Station code for station to be installed/updated/removed/adopted.  The \fIsnet\fP and \fIsta\fP are
combined to make a \fIdlname\fP used in the \fIdlsite\fP table.

.IP timestamp
Must be a valid timestamp.  If you use a date string, surround \fItimestamp\fP by quotes (i.e. "10/28/2008 18:30:00").
.br
\(bu For an installation, this is the certification time used in the \fIdeployment\fP table.  
.br
\(bu For an update, this is the time that the communications change occurred.
.br
\(bu For a removal or drop, this is the decertification time used in the \fIdeployment\fP table.
.br
\(bu For an adoption, this is the decertification and certification time used in the \fIdeployment\fP table.  

.IP comm_provider
String describing who provides the communications (i.e. Wild Blue, ATT, Local TelCo, etc.).  This
is mandatory for an installation and an update.  It is ignored for removals and adoptions.  If you have
spaces in the provider name, surround \fIcomm_provider\fP by quotes (see EXAMPLES).  This value is 
checked against the \fIaccepted_comm_providers\fP found in the parameter file.  A non-fatal alert is 
reported if the \fIcomm_provider\fP supplied is not found in \fIaccepted_comm_providers\fP.

.IP comm_type
String describing the type of communications (i.e. vsat, dsl, cell modem, etc.).  This
is mandatory for an installation but not for an update.  It is ignored for removals and 
adoptions.  If it is not included during an update, the pre-existing \fIcomm.commtype\fP is used.
If you have spaces in the communications type, surround \fIcomm_type\fP by quotes (see EXAMPLES).
This value is checked against the \fIaccepted_comm_types\fP found in the parameter file.  
A non-fatal alert is reported if the \fIcomm_type\fP supplied is not found in \fIaccepted_comm_types\fP.

.SH FILES
.LP 
There are four schema extension tables that are modified by this program:  comm, deployment,
dlsite, and adoption.  See the documentation available via \fBdbhelp(1)\fP for the css3.0 
schema.  See also the additional documentation available in \fBdeployment(5)\fP, \fBadoption(5)\fP,

This parameter file maintains the default locations for various orbs and dbs
such that they do not have to be repeated on the command line unless overrides
are required.

.IP \fIstatus_orb\fP
Status ORB used by the \fBq330_location\fP program during an installation, \fI-I\fP if \fI-n\fP
is not selected.  If the orb is not operational or you do not have access, the program exits.
.IP \fIprelim_orb\fP
Preliminary ORB used to gather the \fIdeployment.time\fP value during an installation, \fI-I\fP.
If the orb is not operational or you do not have access, the program exits.
.IP \fIcmd_orb\fP
Command ORB used to send and receive \fBdlcmds\fP.  Used only during an installation (i.e.
when the \fI-I\fP and \fI-y\fP options are selected).  With the deprecation of \fI-n\fP, the
command orb should not be checked unless you are speicifically requesting updates to a \fIdlsite\fP
table.  If the orb is not operational or you do not have access, the program exits.
.IP \fIwfdb\fP
Use this certified waveform database during a removal or station drop, \fI-R\fP or \fI-D\fP, to gather the 
\fIdeployment.endtime\fP value.  
.IP \fIvnet\fP
Virtual network code to be used in the deployment table.  
.IP \fIpdcc\fP
Data center to be filled in for \fIdeployment.pdcc\fP.  If not filled in, the pdcc is set to -.  
The DMC has some limitation on what can be put in this field.  Contact them for a full definition of a PDCC.
.IP \fIpacket_match\fP
Match statement for packets in the preliminary orb.  These packets are used for start times when using the \fI-I\fP option
for new installations.  The orbselect statement will be \fIsnet_sta_(\fBpacket_match\fP)\fP
.IP \fIchannel_match\fP
Channel subset to use for checking start/end times in wfdisc for installations and removals.  The stage table is also subset
to review for equipment install times using this subset.  Ideally, this would be one vertical channel.  If you have multiple 
sensors with different channel codes installed at different times, the earliest start time in the stage table for the given
station and \fIchannel_match\fP will be used.

.IP \fIadoption_types\fP
Four adoption types are accepted \fIE\fP, \fIT\fP, \fIR\fP and \fIX\fP.  These correspond to an EARN transition,
a transition to regional/national lab network operator, a transition to operation as a REFNET
or Backbone station, or transition to CEUSN/N4 operations.  The \fIatype_phrase\fP is placed in the adoption 
table.  The phrase can be modified, but a standard should be chosen for compatibility with web apps 
that may use the \fIadoption.atype\fP field for sorting.

.IP \fIaccepted_comm_types\fP
A list of comm types that one would expect to see in the comm table.  If you use one that is not listed here
the script alerts but does not die.

.IP \fIaccepted_comm_providers\fP
A list of comm providers that one would expect to see in the comm table.  If you use one that is not listed here

.SH RETURN VALUES
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.IP "\fINo matching records in stage table for stations XXXX\fP"
This is a common message that you will run across if your dbmaster tables are not
updated for the type of dbops change you are trying to make. There are multiple
things to check:

.IP \(bu
Are you matching the proper channels available for that station?  
.LP
The parameter file has a channel sifter in it called \fIchan_match\fP.  For instance,
if you have HHZ channels in your metadata for the particular station and the parameter 
file is set to use BHZ channels (the default), you will see this error.

.IP \(bu
Have you closed off the records for that station in the metadata?  
.LP
If you are working with a removal, \fI-R\fP, or an adoption, \fI-A\fP with an 
adoption type of \fIT|transition\fP or \fIX|CEUSN/N4 conversion\fP you need to have updated
the dbmaster tables to indicate the station is closed.

.IP \(bu
Have you added the metadata for that station to the database?
.LP
If you are working on an installation, \fI-I\fP, the metadata for that station
must be in the input database before running \fBmk_dbops\fP.

.IP "\fIcouldn't find ip address for 'somewhere.ucsd.edu' : 'Name or service not known'\fP"
This means you have no updated your \fImk_dbops.pf\fP file to point to the appropriate orbs
(status, prelim or cmd orbs) or you have not used the command line overrides \fI-S\fP, \fI-P\fP,
or \fI-C\fP.

.IP "\fICan't select XX_XXXX(.*M40|.*M100) packets from prelim orb, somewhere.ucsd.edu:prelim\fP"
Perhaps you are not running a prelim orb to segregate the data.  Check that you have your orbs 
specified correctly.

.IP "\fINo records in certified wf db matching XXXX for chan=~/HNZ|[BH]HZ/\fP"
Check the values of \fIwfdb\fP or possibly \fIchannel_match\fP in \fImk_dbops.pf\fP.  You likely are
pointing at the wrong database where the waveforms reside.  Alternatively, if you are using the \fI-W\fP 
option, you could be pointing at the wrong database.

.SH "BUGS AND CAVEATS"
This script is firmly founded upon assumptions made regarding the operational model
of your network.  Testing has not been attempted for setups outside what is 
in use at the ANF.  For instance, you may run across errors if you do not 
operate separate \fIprelim\fP and \fIcmd\fP orbs.
 
Per agreed upon conventions:  EARN stations retain their same snet_sta, 
TRANSITION stations may change their snet_sta, and REFNET/Backbone 
stations should retain their same snet_sta.  If these conventions change, 
reprogramming, or at least further testing of the current script is necessary.

If using \fI-I\fP mode with the default behavior to pull the oldest data time from
the prelim orb, you must have permission to access the orb.

If using \fI-I\fP or \fI-U\fP mode that checks the status orb, 
you must have permission to access the orb.

User must have write access to dbops tables (adoption, comm, deployment, and dlsite).

If a record cannot be added to a table the program dies.  This could be a problem,
for instance, if one table had a successful update (i.e. comm) and then the update 
to the deployment table fails.  Prior to any updating, the script creates backups 
of all tables to be updated.  They are called \fIdbopsdb.table+\fP and are removed
upon successful completion of the script unless \fI-k\fP is specified.

When updating the dlsite table using \fI-I\fP mode, the \fBq330_location\fP code
is run.  As of the 4.11 release, this \fBq330_location\fP script subsets based on 
a single station. Earlier releases did not subset based on a single station, so 
all stations were reviewed and reported upon.  This caused some problems with null 
values for commtype and provider if there were multiple stations that had not been
added to the deployment table.  Also note that \fBq330_location\fP has copious output. 

If dbmaster tables are not updated for a newly installed station,
you will not be able to update the tables in \fI-I\fP mode.

When running in \fI-I\fP mode, if the newly certified stations have no data
in the default \fIstatus_orb\fP you will have to run \fIq330_location(1)\fP 
by hand.  Alternatively, use the \fI-S\fP option to point at the orb that has the
necessary .*/st packets, likely the \fIprelimORB\fP.

When running in \fI-U\fP mode, if you only have duty cycle status or power type to 
update, you will still need to put in the comm provider in order to convince the script
to update the comm table.

The deployment table subset has been modified to include the vnet.  This should
deal with instances for example where you had a station operational as TA, it was
adopted/transitioned to operations as N4, and then you have to close the station.

As of March 2016, the values for the deployment.time and deployment.endtime fields 
will use more accurate times based on finding first or last data values from
a \fBtrloadchan(3)\fP.  This helps when waveforms are written out with \fBorb2wf(1)\fP
rather than \fBorb2db(1)\fP because \fBorb2wf\fP produces a full daylong wfdisc record
rather than the more detailed time and endtime found from an \fBorb2db\fP wfdisc
record.
