The dt.cc file was made from the dbcorrelate output file using create_ccfile.
The dt.ct file was made by running ph2dt on phase.dat.  phase.dat was created
from the tables ../db using the program db2ph.

Use the scripts

hypodd.csh
hypodd2db.csh

to produce reloc.origin.  The hypocenter values in this file should match the
original locations in ../db.origin fairly well.
