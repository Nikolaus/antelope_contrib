This directory contains a test case for cross-correlation location methods.  
There are four events in the origin table.  The first is exactly at z = 10 km, 
39.2N, 120.0W.  The 2nd is displaced by 1 km west from the 1st.  The 3rd is 
displaced 1 km north from the 1st.  The 4th is displaced 1 km upward from 
the 1st.   Origin times are

1st  00:00:00.000
2nd  01:00:00.000
3rd  02:00:00.000
4th  03:00:00.000

Synthetic waveforms were placed on the records using a homogeneous halfspace
model with Vp = 6 km/s and the known origin times.  This is a little tricky 
because, to have true accuracy, the synthetics must be created at a higher 
rate, say 1000 s/sec, so that they can appear at the right time in the 
waveform files created at 100 s/sec.  Thus, the correlation interevent times 
are only accurate to the nearest 0.01 second.  This somewhat compromises the 
ability to recover the original hypocenters accurately.  Epicenter parameters 
in the table were determined by picking and locating the events in dbloc2 and
so are not precisely the original epicenters.  The depths and origin times 
are, however, precisely the original ones.

The synthetic waveforms for the four events can be viewed with 

% dbpick db

Correlation times are produced with the commands

% ../bin/event_pairs db 10 10 10 20 event_pairs.dat
% ../bin/dbcorrelate db . 0 1.0 0.25 0.0 event_pairs.dat correl_output1.dat
% ../bin/create_ccfile correl_output1.dat dt.cc 0.0 0 0.0 0.5 1

Move the dt.cc file to the subdirectory hypodd.  Events are then relocated 
using HYPODD in the subdirectory hypodd with

% hypodd hypodd.inp

assuming "hypodd" is aliased to the executable location.

The relocated hypocenters are in hypodd.reloc.  The file hypodd.reloc is used 
to create the css3.0 origin and origerr tables with

% ../../bin/hypodd2db hypodd.reloc reloc 1

Relative location results are in reloc.origin, using both catalog times and 
cross-correlation times.  These hypocenters should agree closely 
with the ones in db.origin in this directory.
