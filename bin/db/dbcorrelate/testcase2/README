This directory holds a synthetic test case for dbcorrelate.  It is a little
more thorough than in directory "testcase1" because it uses real seismograms.
The cross-correlation peak values and the relative times between peaks are 
measured in SAC as the basis of comparison.

Note that file correl_output0.dat has write permission removed so that
it can be a basis of comparison when further code changes are made in
dbcorrelate and tested.

This test is based on local seismic signals recorded at station CMN, which is
located at

lat =   37.6275
lon = -121.7083

SAC data are in subdirectory sac.  The "cmn" seismograms were used.  The start 
time of the files were set to

orid = 1) cmn.[zne].o       11:09:56.363
orid = 2) cmn.[zne].o-1hr   10:09:56.363
orid = 3) cmn.[zne].o-2hr+n 09:09:56.363

Sample interval set to 100.00, npts set to 3933.

All signals have the same original amplitude, but about 50% random noise was 
added to the third signal, thus garbling it.

Using SAC, xcor peak CCC = 1.00 for Z-component signals 1 and 2.
Using SAC, xcor peak CCC = 0.77 for Z-component signals 1 and 3 (due to noise).

Used sac2db to create a database.  Put in 3 origin rows, 3 assoc rows, and 
3 arrivals.

Using S-P time of ~ 2.5 sec, the distance to epicenter ~ 20 km.  So origin
time should be ~ 5 sec before P (4 km/s).

Run dbcorrelate with

% ../bin/dbcorrelate db . 0 1.0 0.3 0.0 event_pairs.dat correl_output0.dat

Using perfect picks of P, the result was:

% cat correl_output0.dat

sta ph    orid1  jdate1   orid2  jdate2     CCC       CCCP            tau         otdiff         atdiff

Note that the relative origin times are resolved to within 0.001.  The CCC
peak value is correct for the second event and off by only 0.08 for the third,
compared to SAC result.
