.SH NAME
event_pairs \- determine which event pairs to use in dbcorrelate
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ""
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a preprocessor to dbcorrelate.  It determines which event pairs to use when
cross-correlating signals.  Spatial limits can be imposed on the selection, and a 
maximum number of links per event pair can also be imposed.

The following input parameters are used:

    database = database name to get data from
    xdifmax  = maximum x (E-W) distance within which to accept event 
               pairs for correlation
    ydifmax  = maximum y (N-S) distance within which to accept event 
               pairs for correlation
    zdifmax  = maximum z distance within which to accept event pairs 
               for correlation
    maxlinks = sets an upper cutoff on the number of events to be 
               associated to a given event. This limits the links
               created in a dense volume of earthquakes.  If maxlinks
               = 0, then no upper limit is placed on the number of 
               links.  This may be OK for a small cluster of events,
               but will be unwise for large datasets.  There is no 
               minimum links parameter; while it is true that there
               may be isolated events with only one or two links, a 
               decision on whether or not to use such poorly linked 
               events can be postponed until HYPODD runs.
    outfile =  name of ASCII file to hold the results

    NOTE! In order for this program to work properly, the origin table 
          must have been time sorted.
