.SH NAME
create_ccfile \- reformat dbcorrelate results into file for HYPODD
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "create_ccfile inputfile outputfile cccmin iflag dtchop spdifmin minobs"
.SH DESCRIPTION
create_ccfile forms the HYPODD dt.cc file from the output of dbcorrelate.
Several criteria for selecting data are used.

The following input parameters are used:

  inputfile = cross-correlation (dbcorrelate) output file
  outputfile= HYPODD cross-cor input file, usually "dt.cc"
  cccmin =    minimum cross-correlation coef. value to accept 
              (absolute value, ~ 0.6 to 0.7 normally)
  iflag =     0 means use both neg. and pos. xcor's; 1 mean 
              use only pos.
  dtchop =    do not write dt values whose absolute value 
              exceeds dtchop.  0.0 means ignore this criterion.
              A chop value of around 0.5 would be reasonable.
  spdifmin =  if both P and S xcor's present, they are both 
              rejected if the difference is > spdifmin (~0.1 s 
              would normally be good)
  minobs =    minimum # of xcor's for any event pair; otherwise
              all rejected (1 may be OK if xcor times are used
              in conjunction with normal travel time differences
              in HYPODD for instance)
