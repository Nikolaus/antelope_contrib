.SH NAME
dbcorrelate \- cross-correlate body-wave phases
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B "dbcorrelate database dbpath flag winlen laglen cccmin infile outfile"
.SH DESCRIPTION
dbcorrelate reads in a list of orid pairs and find the matching phases to be
cross-correlated for each event pair and then compute the cross-correlation.
It assumes "event_pairs" has been run.  That preprocessor makes a list of
origin pairs and their respective julian dates, in freeform, thus

orid1 orid2 jdate1 jdate2

For each matching arrival found for a given pair, the waveforms are
cross-correlated to get a delay time estimate for the events, to be used in
relocation of the events, such as in HYPODD.

If the database is broken out into years and days under some directory,
then the database name must be uniform over all years and days such that

dbpath/yyyy/jjj

is the relative path to a daily database.

Note: There may be multiple wfdisc entries that go with a given phase.
Some logic is used to choose the first adequate entry in such cases because
only one waveform can be used in the cross-correlation.

The following input parameters are used:

  database= specifies the database name
  dbpath=   specifies the full path to database
  flag=     (1 or 0) describes the database configuration:
             1 = database is broken out into yyyy/jjj subdirectories
             0 = database is not broken out, just one database 
             in dbpath
  winlen=   length (seconds) of the waveforms to be correlated.
  laglen=   maximum length of waveform offset (seconds) in correlation
  cccmin=   minimum acceptable correlation value (about 0.7)
  infile=   input file (created with "event_pairs" program)
  outfile=  output file in which results are written
