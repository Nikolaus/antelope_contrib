This directory holds the software for dbcorrelate, a program to correlate P and
S waveforms at common stations in order to get differential times for HYPODD.
It uses Antelope libraries.  Three supporting programs

event_pairs 
create_ccfile
hypodd2db 

are also included. The first is a preprocessor for dbcorrelate.  The second is a
post-processor for dbcorrelate, and it makes the HYPODD dt.cc file.  The third
is a program to convert HYPODD *.reloc files to Antelope origin and, optionally,
origerr tables.
