# Moment Tensor Code

### CODE DEPENDENCY:
The demo code will make some shell calls to SAC. The SAC software
is distributed for free by IRIS but you need to request a copy
by hand on their website. http://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/forms/sac/
For development I'm including a copy of the code on the subfolder
NOT_TO_DISTRIBUTE tha you can install on your computer before running
the demo code.



### Building from source
You need to have $ANTELOPE defined in your environment. Then run...

    make;
    make install;

### Running the demo code
The Dreger's source code is included in the distribution
and we include a full example to work on the original
code. The data needed for the example is located on
the folder "EXAMPLE".

For this you have to:

    make; make install;
    dbmoment -d EXAMPLE/example_1 1



And you will see a new "mt" table on that TESTDB used.
