The dbmoment tool implementation included in the distribution is
the core component of the more complex TDMT_INV toolbox that is in
use by other networks. We completed this first step of mapping the
source data and the final results values to Antelope but many steps in the
middle are out of our control and in need of evaluation. This first
version lacks the capability of correctly resampling the data to match
the synthetics and deconvolve the instrument response from the traces.

The example dataset included on the distribution is already preprocessed
to those requirements and the dbmoment code can produce good results with
it. At this time if the tool is used to evaluate any external dataset the
user is responsible for the preprocessing of the data. The data should be
resampled to 1Hz and all instrument responses removed from it. Then we
need new wfdisc records tracking those new files. We also need an event for
those traces and arrivals associated with those traces. The system should be able
to correctly analyze the event and produce a valid result. In any other
condition the tool will most like output a core file and crash.



### CODE DEPENDENCY:
The demo code will make some shell calls to SAC. The SAC software
is distributed for free by IRIS but you need to request a copy
by hand on their website. http://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/forms/sac/
For development I'm including a copy of the code on the subfolder
NOT_TO_DISTRIBUTE tha you can install on your computer before running
the demo code.



### Building from source
You need to have $ANTELOPE defined in your environment. Then run...

    make;
    make install;

### Running the demo code
The Dreger's source code is included in the distribution
and we include a full example to work on the original
code. The data needed for the example is located on
the folder "EXAMPLE".

For this you have to:

    make; make install;
    dbmoment -d EXAMPLE/example_1 1



And you will see a new "mt" table on that TESTDB used.
