The dbmoment tool implementation included in the distribution is
the core component of the more complex TDMT_INV toolbox that is in
use by multiple seismic networks. We completed this first step of
mapping the source data and the final results values to Antelope.

All data gets evaluated as velocity at 1Hz before inversion. The
instrument response will be convolved into the synthetic trace
instead of deconvolving the real trace from the station.

Inversion will have the same limitations as the original Dreger's
code and users should be familiar with Dreger's documentation.


### CODE DEPENDENCY:
-NONE-
We removed all external dependencies to SAC and all data processing
is perform in Antelope.


### Building from source
You need to have $ANTELOPE defined in your environment. Then run in
this directory...

    make;
    make install;

### Running the demo code
The Dreger's inversion source code is included in the distribution
and we include 2 full examples from the original distribution.
The data needed for the example is located on folders "EXAMPLE_1" and
"EXAMPLE_2". You can run the code from the same repo or run the script
*run_dbmoment_example* to automate the process.

For this you have to:

    make clean; make; make install;
    cd ~
    run_dbmoment_example

This will go to the example folder "$ANTELOPE/contrib/example/dbmoment/" and
will run both examples. You will see several new folders.

    .dbmoment       => Temp folder for calculations.
    synthetics_db   => Includes all databases for synthetics.
    dbmoment_images => Default folder to save the results in PNG files.
    mt db tables    => Results will go into a new 'mt' table.
