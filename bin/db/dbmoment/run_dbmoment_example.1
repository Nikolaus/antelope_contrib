.TH RUN_DBMOMENT_EXAMPLE 1

.SH NAME
run_dbmoment_example \- run dbmoment on 2 example events

.SH SYNOPSIS
The Dreger's inversion source code is included in the contributed code
repo as well as 2 full examples from the original distribution.
The data needed for the example is located on folders "EXAMPLE_1" and
"EXAMPLE_2".

Inversion will have the same limitations as the original Dreger's
code and users should be familiar with Dreger's documentation.


.SH ENVIRONMENT AND DEPENDENCIES
You need to have $ANTELOPE defined in your environment. Then
compile the source code.

    make;
    make install;


.SH PARAMETER FILE
None.

.SH EXAMPLE
You can run the dbmoment code by hand from the same repo or
run *run_dbmoment_example* to automate the process.

For this you have to:

    make clean; make; make install;
    cd ~
    run_dbmoment_example

This will go to the example folder "$ANTELOPE/contrib/example/dbmoment/" and
will run both examples. You will see several new folders.

    .dbmoment       => Temp folder for calculations.
    synthetics_db   => Includes all databases for synthetics.
    dbmoment_images => Default folder to save the results in PNG files.
    mt db tables    => Results will go into a new 'mt' table.
