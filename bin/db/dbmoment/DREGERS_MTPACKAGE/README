# EXAMPLE_CODE

Folder is intended to facilitate the use of the original Dreger's code
with the dbmoment tool. The original source and several helper functions
are in this folder. Doing a "make; make install;" on the folder will
produce all requred code and will add it to your Antelope folder
structure. Then you can go to the directory with the example data and
configuratoin file to run the example: " cd ../example/ "

FOLDERS:
All folders here are require by the original code. There are commands on
our Makefile to go into those folders and compile the code that we need.
There should be no need for you to compile anything on them by hand.
    1) GETPAR
    2) NRC
    3) STDPLT

### OTHER CODE

## example2wfdisc
Script intended to bring Dreger’s example data to Antelope and test the validity
of the dbmoment code against the original code example.

This code will create a wfdisc table referencing the data for the examples in
Dreger’s MTPACKAGE code. The Examples in the distribution are written in plain
text (ascii) following Helmberger Format for seismograms. There is a small
header for every trace. The header contains the samplerate and the total number
of samples. The start and endtime are omitted and we are forced to set the
trace to start at 0 and end at (total_points * samplerate) time.
The names of the channels are hardcoded on the original code that extract the
information and it maps to [ T, R and Z]. The format will be specified as “as”
and the data type to “D” (displacement) in the wfdisc.

To use:
```
$ make

produce example2wfdisc

$ cd ../moment_tensor/example

$ example2wfdisc sta1 testdata1 TESTDB
$ example2wfdisc sta2 testdata2 TESTDB
$ example2wfdisc sta3 testdata3 TESTDB

$ dbselect TESTDB.wfdisc

```


A second use for this code:

We can use this to verify the functionality of the Fortran wrapper that is
producing our Green functions. The original Dreger's code will output a final
ascii formatted time domain Green's fucntions after you run the run_fkrsort
code. The order of the 8 traces is important and the documentation specify it
as: TSS, TDS, XSS, XDS, XDD, ZSS, ZDS, ZDD.

If there are 3 channels it will use T,R and Z. The second group of 8 channel
names will be used otherwise.
