<description>
This probe runs the \B\nagios_check_orbstat\P\ Nagios plugin with the -u
option to check an orb for the latency value of a particular client to the
orb. The orb, client name, and corresponding latency time thresholds are
specified in the probe parameters. Thresholds are specified in seconds.

The check is executed from the Intermapper server. It uses the address assigned
to the probe object, checking the request \M\Orbport\P\

\B\Parameters:\P\

\MB\Orbport\P\ - The Antelope port name or number to check. Can be any valid
name as defined in \I\orbserver_names.pf\P\. Default value is empty which means
use the Antelope default port.

\MB\Alarm\P\ and \MB\Critical\P\ - Latency threshold to set an alarm or Critical
state. Values must be expressed as a decimal number.
\MB\Alarm\P\ defaults to \I\600\P\. \MB\Critical\P\ defaults to \I\900\P\

\MB\Clientname\P\ - The orb client name used to check the latency. Not a regex.
