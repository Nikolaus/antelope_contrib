#include "multiwavelet.h"
/* This function computes theoretical arrival times and a slowness vector
(at the reference station for an array) based on a model and method
defined in a parameter file and using the generic travel time interface
of datascope/antelope.  

Arguments:
///inputs////
	stations - Associative array of MWstation objects used in 
			multiwavelet programs
	refsta - name of reference station to use.  The slowness 
		vector is computed based on a source location accessed
		through the db pointer (see below) and the location of
		the reference station.  If the refsta is not found in 
		the stations array the first element of the sorted list
		of stations will be used in an attempt to recover.  For
		most arrays this would be a minor error.
	phase - name of seismic phase to compute theoretical times and
		slowness vector for.  
	db - This db pointer MUST point to a single row of a db view with 
		the origin table joined as part of the view.   The hypocenter
		information is read with dbgetv passing this db pointer 
		directly.
	pf - parameter space pointer.  We search for model and method
		fields from pf to get the interface right. 
///outputs///
	times - associative array keyed by station name of theoretical
		arrival times (stored as double * s).  If there are 
		problems computing any travel times they will be absent
		from this array.  When this array is used, be aware you
		can't assume all the times are filled.
	slow - theoretical slowness vector.  If the slowness vector
		calculation fails this is set to 0 and the refsta field
		is set to "BAD".  This allows the use of the slowness 
		vector without errors in a less than ideal way.  The 
		BAD condition should be trapped.

Return codes:
	0 = normal return, no problems
	> 0 = count of travel time failures
	< 0 = nothing was computed.  Both slowness and times should be
		assumed invalid.
