makes has been placed into the 'nobuild' directory because

it has been deprecated. The program may still work and may be
of value, however the author(s) offer absolutely no promises or
support for it.

the author(s) have deemed that the source code may be of
community interest, however for any number of reasons believe
it should not be compiled routinely into the main Antelope
distribution (unfinished, untested, pitfalls for the uninitiated,
parochial interest only, architectural or coding problems,
speculative approach, etc.)

These additional build rules were used by code in the vorb project, and are not
necessary on Linux or Darwin platforms.
