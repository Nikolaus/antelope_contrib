.TH RTP2ORB 1 "March 10, 2003"
.SH NAME
rtp2orb \- Import data from a RefTek RTPD data server into an Antelope ORB
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
rtp2orb [ -v ] \fIconfiguration_file\fR
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBRrtp2orb\fR collects data from a Refraction Technology, Inc.
data server (RTPD) and writes them to an Antelope ORB as GENC packets
raw and/or TRACE_BUF format packets.
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
.TP 12
.B -v
Turn on packet logging.  If this option is given, then a terse header
of each packet which is sent to the ORB is printed on stdout.
.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
The program requires the path name of a configuration file
which contains all the run time parameter specifications, as described in the
next section.
.SH PARAMETER FILE
The basic format consists of an identifer followed by one or more arguments.
Blank lines and everything following the '#" symbol are ignored.  Below is
a list of all recognized identifiers and their arguments.
.TP 8
.B ORB      \fIOrbHost PortNumber\fR

Give the fully qualified host name, or dot decimal IP address of the ORB
server, followed by the port number.  If you are running this on the same
computer as the ORB server, then specify "localhost" as the host name.

.TP 8
.B RTPD     \fIRTPDHost PortNumber\fR

Give the fully qualified host name, or dot decimal IP address of the RTPD
server, followed by the port number.  If you are running this on the same
computer as the RTP server, then specify "localhost" as the host name.

.TP 8
.B Database \fIPathName\fR

Give the path name of the "database" to use to map from digitizer
packet headers into station, channel, network names, calib and calper.
In the default build of rtp2orb this is simply a flat file lookup table,
described in the next section, however one could fairly easily substitute
an Antelope database by changing db.c, if desired.

.TP 8
.B DASid    \fIUnitId\fR

The RTPD protocol allows you to request data from a single, specific,
DAS or from all DAS(es).  There is no provision for requesting data from
a subset of the available digitizers.  If you want data from a single DAS,
give its unit id here, otherwise enter 0 to select all digitizers.

.TP 8
.B StrMask  \fIStreamList\fR

You may filter the DT packets based on stream.  List the stream id's you
want to see.  The stream codes here are the one-based values that are
used by people, not the zero-based values that are in the headers.

.SH LOOKUP TABLE
As mentioned in the above section, the default build of rtp2orb supports
mapping from digitzer packet header fields to station, channel, network, location
and segment codes, and calib and calper, via a lookup table. In this table
blank lines and everything following the '#" symbol are ignored.  The table
consists of an arbitrary number of lines of exactly 10 tokens each.  The
first 3 tokens are the unit id, stream number and channel number from the "DT"
packet header.  The stream and channel numbers are the one-based values that
are used by people when configuring the digitizer using RefTek supplied tools,
not the zero-based value that is actually in the header.  The next four arguments
are the character strings giving the station, channel, network, and location
codes.  This is followed by two floating point numbers which give the values
for calib and calper.

# Example table for use with rtp2orb.  This file defines the

# Note that stream number here is the one-based value that

.PP
If the program encounters a packet which does not have a corresponding entry in
the lookup table, then it generates the names as follows.  The station code is
simply the unit id, the channel code is the given a name of the form "st:ch" where
"st" is the stream number and "ch" is the channel number, the network code is
given as "N?", the location code as "L?", and the segment type as "S?".  Undefined
calib and calper values are 1.0 and -1.0, respectively.
.SH NOTES
The RefTek DT packets are incomplete, in that they do not explicitly specify the
sample interval.  This program works around that by computing the sample interval
by comparing sequential packets for each unit/stream/channel combination.  Since
it takes two packets before the sample interval can be known, the first packet for
each unit/stream/channel combination is discarded, and a message to that effect
is printed on stdout.  This is normal and expected behavior.
