This directory contains the RefTek supplied library source required
to build rtp2orb.  They require GNU make. To create the libraries,
change to the src directory, edit the Makefile as appropriate so that
GNU make is defined and type 'make'.  This will create a lib/solaris.sparc
subdirectory off of this one (don't worry if this is not a Solaris sparc system,
as the name has no significance outside of the RefTek build environment).
